## 🎯 How to Interact With DroxAI

### YES! You can talk to it like a human! 👥

DroxAI is designed for natural, conversational interaction. Here are the main ways to communicate:

#### 1. **Web Dashboard** (Visual Interface)
- Open browser: `http://0.0.0.0:3000`
- **Click, monitor, and control** through the web interface
- View real-time metrics, logs, and system status

#### 2. **Natural Language Commands** (Talk to it!)
You can say things like:

**Casual & Friendly:**
```
"Hey DroxAI, can you help me create a new API endpoint?"
"What anomalies have you detected today?"
"Show me the system metrics"
"I need to optimize some slow database queries"
"Generate a Python script to process CSV files"
"Can you analyze this code for potential bugs?"
```

**Technical & Specific:**
```
"Generate an async API client with retry logic and error handling"
"Execute anomaly detection on CPU metrics with 0.8 threshold"
"Deploy a swarm of code analysis agents"
"Apply hot reload to the llm_integration module"
"Create a security audit for the authentication system"
```

**Goal-Oriented:**
```
"I need to improve our API response times by 50%"
"Set up monitoring for our microservices"
"Create an automated code review system"
"Deploy agents to optimize our database performance"
```

#### 3. **API Commands** (Programmatic)
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://0.0.0.0:3000/health

# Generate code
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:3000/api/llm/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Create a REST API for user management"}'

# Get metrics
curl http://0.0.0.0:3000/metrics

# Monitor events
curl http://0.0.0.0:3000/api/events
```

#### 4. **WebSocket** (Real-time)
Connect to `ws://0.0.0.0:3001` for real-time updates and commands.

## 🎮 Communication Style Guide

### ✅ **DO talk naturally** - DroxAI understands context

**Human-like examples:**
- "Hey, can you help me build a file processing system?"
- "I'm seeing some weird performance issues, can you investigate?"
- "Show me what's happening with the system right now"
- "I need some code to connect to a PostgreSQL database"
- "What agents are currently running?"

### ✅ **Be specific when needed** - But don't worry about exact syntax

**Specific examples:**
- "Create a Python function that reads JSON files and validates the data"
- "Monitor CPU usage and alert me if it goes above 80%"
- "Generate unit tests for this authentication module"
- "Set up a webhook endpoint that processes payment notifications"
- "Analyze all Python files in this directory for security issues"

### ✅ **Give context** - It helps DroxAI understand better

**Context-rich examples:**
- "I'm building an e-commerce site, help me create a product catalog API"
- "Our database queries are slow, can you optimize them?"
- "I need to process log files from our web server"
- "Create a dashboard that shows real-time user activity"
